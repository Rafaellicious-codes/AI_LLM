In this exercise you will compare Context Augmentation, which consists in importing a document (as text) into a Prompt to Retrieval-Augmented Generation, in which the document is converted into a vector representation using the same embeddings or encoding method that the LLM uses to process input text. This ensures that the document can be used seamlessly in the same latent space as the model's understanding."
